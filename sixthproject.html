          <h2 style="text-align: justify; color: white; line-height: 45px;"> Freelance mission: Website development & Brand building for a restoration business</h2> 
          <p style="font-size: 18px; color: white; text-align: justify;"><br>
          	This work is dedicated for the owner of Venti CAFE-RESTAURANT in Khzema, Sousse (Tunisia) who sought the growth of his business. He was looking for an additional marketing channel and refining his market positioning.<br>
          	The suggestion of a website for his brand contained the following aspects:</p>
          	<ul style="font-size: 18px; color: white; text-align: justify;">
          		<li>Enhancing Brand Identity</li>
          		<li>Presentation & Layout design</li>
          		<li>Understanding of the market positioning</li>
          	</ul>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: white; text-align: justify;">
          	Based on the Web Developement requirements and users' research we created a rough prototype and basic wireframes of the suggested media channel of promotion to our Client VENTI CAFE. The following PPT resumes the starategy of mapping the site that ensures embodying a user-freindly information architecture. <br></p>

          <p style="font-size: 18px; color: white; text-align: justify;"><br>The following teaser is a rough visulization of the user- interface that was optimized iteratively with guidance from market research, usability tests and interview of inspection with our client. Early feedbacks were extremely helpful and agile-orientd. Our client goal was to widen the promotion channels of his business in order to enhance its flourishment. 
          <br>Thus, our objective was to create a <strong>GREAT USER EXPERIENCE! </strong>Fortuanately the latter seems to fullfill smartly the former! </p>
