in Design Engineering</h2> 
          <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #5E4700; text-align: justify;"><br>
          	<strong>This Project is about testing and refining an ontology called pain-model. It depicts Problems from the collected then illustrated Use-Cases and classifies them into standardized classes; (Field of application : Daily life of elderly).</strong><br>
          	<br>As a design engineering team under the direction of Professor Bernard Yannou., we aimed to run an experiment on how we can extract a complete and concise inventory of a user's problems, illustrated in a storyboard. We try through this experiment to give insights about solutions for a better state of living for users by depicting their daily tangible and potential problems. The following link displays the platform that i developped for the experimentation, which as well provides the results with their relative explanation: <strong> <a style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://chouchener.github.io/chouchener/">Link to the Experiment Platform.</a></strong> <br> </p>

              How do men and women aged 70 years and older spend their day? In order to answer this question, we described activity profiles in terms of the frequency, the duration, and the variety of all possible activities, as well as their physical and social contexts.<br><br>
              Once we had clustered Personas' journeys according to our research purpose, we tried to unfold the  related problems (pains) that can be generated due to the lack or absence of needed abilities to fullfill the corresponding activities. <br><br>
              We tried to list the existing solutions to each evoked problem, only when they are relevant to the context of living of the studied persona (e.g. some solutions are too expensive to afford for a certain population of a certain social status). <br><br>
              Finally, we attempted to use the Dependency Structure Modeling Value Bucket tool (DSM-VB) to be able to delemit the painful situations that have the minimum existing solutions or at all. The ultimate purpose was to use these painful situations as our perimeter of ambition (see RID methodology) to study them and use them afterward as illustrative situations during the experiment.
