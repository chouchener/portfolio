          <p style="font-size: 18px; color: #5E4700; text-align: justify;"><br>
          Generally, the traditional approach of innovation is based on creating products for advanced economies first. However, recently products from poor became very appealing to the customers from developped countries! Western companies tend to assume that consumers in developed markets, who are brand-conscious and performance-sensitive, will never want products from emerging markets, even if their prices are lower.  <br> Yet, the research team of MIT concluded five design principles to successfully enter the emerging markets as well as providing adapted releases to the westerns.
          	<br> The teaser below explains through concrete examples the origin, criticality and imsportance of reverse innovation nowadays. This project is produced for the sake of academic-oriented conference.
